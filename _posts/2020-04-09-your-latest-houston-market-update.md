Today I’m sharing a quick update about what’s happening in the Houston real estate market. Overall, activity has slowed down, for justifiable reasons. However, dozens of homes continue to be listed daily. I encourage you to use this essential document called the “COVID-19 Addendum” if you’re going to be involved in a real estate transaction within the next few months.
