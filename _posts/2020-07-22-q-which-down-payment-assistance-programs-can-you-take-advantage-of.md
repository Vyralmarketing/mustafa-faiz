If you’re thinking of buying a home, there are several down payment assistance programs that encourage homeownership here in Texas.&nbsp;

The money they provide varies from person to person, but it generally ranges from $5,000 to $17,000. **One of the main benefits of these programs is that the minimum credit score to qualify for them remains just 620.** If you’ve been following the mortgage industry lately, you know that many banks and mortgage companies have increased their minimum credit score. Some aren’t even considering applications from anyone with a score of less than 700. At the same time, the interest rate will be the same as a conventional or FHA loan.&nbsp;

Additionally, sellers can contribute to the closing costs so that you end up paying very little out of pocket. In these cases, the earnest money, inspection fees, and appraisal fees are the only costs you’d pay out of pocket.&nbsp;

To get a better idea of what kind of assistance you’d receive, here are some recent examples of purchase prices of homes that closed in 30 days or less:

* $285,000: With an interest rate of 3.875%, the buyer received $11,193
* $205,000: With an interest rate of 3.25%, the buyer received $6,038
* $158,000: With an interest rate of 3.75%, the buyer received $6,206
* $250,000: With an interest rate of 3.25%, the buyer received $9,818

If you’d like to know more about these and other programs, talk to a loan officer who’s familiar with them—not every loan officer knows how they work. I know plenty of excellent loan officers I’d be happy to refer you to, so just give me a call if you’d like to know more.&nbsp;
