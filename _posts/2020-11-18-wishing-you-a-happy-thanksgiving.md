<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what I’m grateful for this Thanksgiving.</em></p>

2020 has been quite challenging for all of us, but now that Thanksgiving is here, it’s time for all of us to reflect on what we’re grateful for.&nbsp;

I’m grateful for the health and wellbeing of my family: my parents, siblings, wife, and children. I’m grateful we all have a roof over our heads and food on the table, and that we can still go out and enjoy life’s simple pleasures.&nbsp;

I’m also thankful for all of my clients. **You’ve put your faith in me and my team to help with your real estate needs, and that’s contributed to my life and livelihood.** This year has tested us and forced us to become a better version of ourselves. It’s made us adapt, become resilient, and respond to our circumstances, no matter how tough they may be.&nbsp;

I hope you have many things to be grateful for this year—things that may seem trivial, but that you actually enjoy. I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your friends and family. If there’s anything I can help you with, real estate or otherwise, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&nbsp;
