Today’s video is a little bit different. Instead of covering buyer or seller tips, we’re going to look at real estate in a different way. I’m going to share my top three favorite Houston-area parks, which are all valuable pieces of real estate for what they provide to those who visit.

**The one thing all of these three parks have in common is that they are great places to fish.** Most of the time, I don’t get lucky, but I always have fun. When I do catch something, it’s a bonus. All three of these parks are within the city of Houston, and you should check them out as soon as possible:

**3\. Darren Goforth Park.** This is close to the Cyprus area. It has a huge lake, which has a great path around it for walking and running. There’s even a little dog beach, too. If you’re really into fishing, this is your top choice.

**2\. Mary Jo Peckham Park.** This isn’t as big as the others, but it has so many trees and greenery, along with lots of shade and even mini islands. Not a lot of people know about it, but it’s truly a hidden gem in the city.

**1\. Kickerillo-Mischer Preserve.** This park has been my favorite to visit. It’s as close as you can get to nature within the city of Houston. It’s in the Northwest area of town right off of 249. I love being here to be present in nature, having a picnic, doing some fishing, or just some exercise. This spot is famous for bird watching as well.

I know you’re going to love all three of these parks. If you have any others that I should add to my list or want to tell me about your experiences, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to talk with you soon.
