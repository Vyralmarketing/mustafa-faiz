<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An amazing new feature allows you to see listings that aren’t even on the market yet.</em></p>

The Houston Association of Realtors recently launched an amazing new feature that allows real estate agents to see what properties are going to be coming soon on the market.&nbsp;

These listings are not available to the public—you won’t even find them on websites like Zillow or Realtor.com\!

However, since it is available to real estate agents, I would be more than happy to share this new feature with you.

**This technology gives buyers the benefit of a heads up on which properties are going to be listed within the next two weeks.&nbsp;**

Some of the properties have pictures, allowing you to scroll through the property photos to get a glimpse that other competing buyers won’t have access to.&nbsp;

Many of these listings may not have photos, but all of them have the essential information like pricing, size, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

With this feature, we can get a head start on communicating with the seller’s agents and be the first ones to see it and make an offer on it.

If you have any questions or would like to view which properties are coming soon to the market, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to help you.
