<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is a fantastic tool to build your credit while you’re still renting.</em></p>

Today I have a quick tip for you if you’ve been renting a property and want to use your rental history to help your credit score.

I was recently made aware of a service called [rentreporters.com.](https://www.rentreporters.com/) **If you go to their website, they offer a service where they will report your on-time rental payments to the credit bureaus, which will help raise your credit score.**

This is a fantastic service for any renters who are trying to build their credit. Mortgages are always reported, but why isn’t rent? I haven’t personally used them and this is not an endorsement, but **I have talked to others who have used the service to increase their credit score to qualify to purchase a home.**

If you have any questions about this or anything else related to real estate , don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
