{% include youtube.html %}Doing a buyer’s walk-through is extremely important. A buyer’s walk-through (or a final walk-through) is a crucial step before the closing where the buyer and the real estate agent go to reexamine the property and make sure that the property is in the same condition in which they originally found it. It is not a reinspection of the property, so it shouldn't take you multiple hours.

There are three things you need to pay attention to when conducting a final walk-through:

**1\. Make sure that all repairs are done.** You may want to go item by item, walk through the house and confirm all the promised repairs have been addressed.

**2\. Determine that everything is working.** For example, check that the garage opener works, the remotes are functioning, the water heater is still creating hot water, the A/C is cooling down or warming up the home, and so on. Also, verify that no moisture has gotten into the home from recent storms or floods. If any damage has been caused, it’s still the seller’s property, so those need to be addressed before it becomes yours.&nbsp;

**3\. Establish that all negotiated items are still present.** Any items that were supposed to be left for you should still be there. For example, the refrigerator, the washer and dryer, the speaker system, the alarm system, and so on.&nbsp;

Do not sign on the dotted line to purchase the home until you have done all three of these things\!&nbsp;
