2020 as a whole was a hot seller’s market driven by low interest rates and low inventory. Those conditions have naturally spilled over into the new year, and they’re making it hard for buyers to find a good house, and if they do, there’s a good chance they’ll have to compete against other offers for it. Fortunately, if you are a buyer, there are three strategies my team and I have perfected that you can use to find an ideal off-market property you don’t have to compete for:

**1\. Circle prospecting (within the community you’re looking to buy in).** For example, if a client is looking for a two-story home with a pool that’s somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 square feet in the Alianna subdivision, we have the tools to identify such properties and call the homeowners to see if they’re interested in selling. Last year, using this strategy alone, we were able to find multiple properties for our clients.&nbsp;

**2\. Online marketing.** In this case, we’d create a Facebook ad saying something to the effect of: “We have homebuyers who are looking for a two-story, 3,000-square-foot home in your neighborhood. If you’re seeing this ad and are interested in selling your property, please reach out to us\!”

**3\. Direct mail.** Nothing beats sending a good old-fashioned letter or postcard in the mail to potential home sellers.&nbsp;

These strategies have been proven to work. Keep in mind, however, that they require a lot of time and effort from your real estate agent, so make sure you hire a good one. If you’d like to enlist my team’s help in finding your next home or have any questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;
