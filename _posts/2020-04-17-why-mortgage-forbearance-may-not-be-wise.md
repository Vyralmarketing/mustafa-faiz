Today Iâ€™m discussing mortgage forbearance and why it may not be the best option. The relief opportunity of a mortgage forbearance allows you to delay payments for three months to a year. In fact, most major banks are automatically deferring payments for up to three months right now. However, you need to speak to your mortgage lender to find out when exactly those deferred payments will be due. Many lenders are expecting the deferred payments right at the end of the deferment period. To learn more about mortgage forbearance, watch the short video above.
