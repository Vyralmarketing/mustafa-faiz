Selling your home can be stressful, but there are ways you can make it a bit easier. Avoiding these six common mistakes will make the process much smoother:

**1\. Picking the wrong agent.** The right agent is not only professional, responsive, and knowledgeable about the market, they’re also honest. They won’t always tell you what you want to hear, but they will tell you what you need to hear.

**2\. Overpricing your home.** A well-priced home will sell even in a bad market. We’re in a seller’s market right now, but correct pricing is still important to attract more buyers and get the highest offer possible.

**3\. Ignoring simple repairs.** Some sellers leave these repairs for the buyers, but you don't want the buyers to notice these and think there might be something else wrong with it.

**4\. Leaving the home cluttered.** I saw a new home the other day that blew me away with the amount of clutter it had. It distracts the buyers from the house itself and will lead to lower offers.

**5\. Restricting access to the house.** If you turn away buyers from showing, they rarely come back. It’s important to make sure agents can easily set up appointments.

**6\. Getting too emotional about your home.** Your home is a product, and it’s competing with all the other homes out there. You don’t want to hold it back with objections that are based on emotion. We want to try and work through objections, otherwise the home could be on the market for a very long time.
