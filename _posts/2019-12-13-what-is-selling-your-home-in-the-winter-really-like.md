Conventional wisdom tells us that winter is the slowest time of year for real estate and there is some truth to this. However, just because there are fewer buyers and sellers active on the market during this season, that doesn’t mean activity comes to a halt. In fact, homes tend to sell faster during the winter than any other time of year. There are two main reasons this is the case:&nbsp;

**1\. There’s less competition among sellers.** Many sellers falsely assume that this is a bad time of year to list, so they steer clear of the market until spring rolls around. This allows sellers who do make a move during the winter to stand out and command a higher level of interest thanks to the lack of options available to buyers.

**2\. Buyers are more serious in the winter.** Because so few listings are available through these later months of the year, the buyers who *do* choose to start their home search in the winter are generally quite eager to strike a deal. There are also tax benefits to closing before the end of the year—namely, the Homestead Exemption. For this, and many other reasons (such as job transfers or end-of-year bonuses), winter buyers are bound to put forward some of the best buyers sellers will see all year.
