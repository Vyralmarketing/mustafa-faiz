As a buyer, you can strengthen your offer tremendously in this market by waiving the appraisal addendum.

First, let’s define the appraisal addendum. **This addendum allows you to waive your right to cancel a contract if the property appraises for lower than the offered price.** For example, let’s say you and the seller enter into an agreement for you to purchase their property for $400,000. In the appraisal addendum, you’ll declare your intentions if the property appraises below $400,000. If you waive the appraisal and the property appraises for, say, $390,000, you’re basically saying you’ll cover that $10,000 gap. If you don’t waive the appraisal, what happens next is up for negotiation.&nbsp;

**Essentially, waiving the appraisal gives you an advantage over other buyers** because you’re ensuring sellers that they don’t need to worry about renegotiating in the event of a low appraisal. I normally wouldn’t advise buyers to take on this strategy, but in a strong seller’s market like this one where any home listed under $400,000 receives 15 to 20 offers the very first day, you need to make your offer as strong as possible.&nbsp;

In this red-hot market, buyers are hardly giving any thought to price because they’re securing such low interest rates (2.6%, 2.7%, etc.). The challenge is actually getting the contract, so getting a contract is akin to securing a deal. More and more buyers are waiving their appraisals, so you’ll have to compete in the appraisal world as well, just in case the offer comes in lower.&nbsp;
