Do you want to get more offers on your home when it hits the market? The more buyers you have looking at your property, the better your chances are of securing top dollar.&nbsp;

So if attracting more traffic to your listing is something you’d like to do, then try these three tips:

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1\. Use professional photography.** First impressions are key, and the majority of today’s buyers begin their home search online. Therefore, the photos you use to represent your property on online listings could make or break your success. These photos should not only convey the look and feel of your home, but the atmosphere of the neighborhood, as well. Thanks to drone technology, achieving this is much easier than it was in the past.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. Price your home strategically.** It’s always better to list slightly below market value and drive demand up than to overprice your home and hope for the best. Modern buyers savvy— they know a good deal when they see one. Likewise, they know when a home is overpriced. If you want to sell above market value, the key is to price your home low. This can generate a bidding war and help you walk away with top dollar at the end of the deal.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Hold a “mega open house.”** By listing your property in the middle of the week but turn away showings until the weekend, at which point you’ll host an open house, the number of buyers who show up to see your home is sure to be higher than it would typically be. And when buyers see all the other people who are interested in your home, you can be sure they’ll put their best foot forward when writing you an offer.&nbsp;
